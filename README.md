# EndianPlayer

This is a page intended to be a web launcher for [Endian](https://github.com/RatLabStudio/Endian).

All it does is display an iFrame of the game, with the ability to make it take up the entire screen. The reason I made this is so that whether the game is accessible or not, there is a page for it.

If the iFrame is saying that it cannot access the page, then the game servers are probably not running. You can download a copy of the project from the [GitHub](https://github.com/RatLabStudio/Endian) and run it locally if you'd like.
